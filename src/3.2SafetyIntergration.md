# Safety Intergration
These are the 3 safety intergration we can use in our machine

Conveyor Belt Safety Barrier:
A safety barrier around the conveyor belt is essential to prevent people from accidentally putting their hands or objects into the moving parts of the belt. If a person gets too close to the machinery, there is a risk of injury from the moving components. The barrier serves as a physical safeguard, reducing the chances of accidents. Additionally, it helps protect the equipment from potential damage caused by foreign objects or interference.

Emergency Stop: 
An emergency stop is a critical safety feature for any robotic system. It provides an immediate way to halt the robotâ€™s operation in case of a malfunction, emergency, or when maintenance is required. This can be activated manually by the operator. The emergency stop ensures that in the event of a fault or a dangerous situation, the robot can be quickly deactivated, preventing further harm or damage. It's a fundamental safety protocol for robots in industrial settings.

Proximity Sensor: 
A proximity sensor enhances the safety of the robot by detecting nearby people or objects. If someone enters the robot's operational area, the sensor triggers the robot to stop, reducing the risk of injury. This is especially important in environments where humans and robots work in close proximity. Furthermore, the proximity sensor can also prevent the robot from moving out of its designated workspace, ensuring the robot operates within safe boundaries. This adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring both the safety of personnel and the proper functioning of the system.
