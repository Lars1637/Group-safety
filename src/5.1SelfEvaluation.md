# Group Evaluation 

During this project, communication proved to be a significant challenge, both within the team and with the client. Miscommunication often led to unclear task divisions and inefficiencies, which delayed progress. These experiences highlighted the importance of clear and consistent communication for aligning expectations and maintaining an efficient workflow. The group recognizes that better planning, task delegation, and earlier deadlines could have prevented many of these issues.

Despite these challenges, the group adapted to constraints such as a limited budget and late delivery of components, demonstrating flexibility and resourcefulness.

From a technical perspective, the project provided varying opportunities for growth. Team members enhanced their collaboration skills, gained experience with tools like GitHub, Visual Studio, and PlantUML, and improved their understanding of hardware and software integration. Some members also developed new skills, such as programming on a Raspberry Pi, coding for CNC mills, and using SolidCAM for manufacturing.

Leadership and risk management were also areas of development. Taking on leadership roles and managing team dynamics presented challenges but also fostered growth in assertiveness and task management. Risk identification and mitigation, supported by tools like PlantUML diagrams, contributed to the project’s stability and highlighted the need for data-driven approaches in future risk assessments.

The group recognizes the need for proactive efforts to ensure deadlines are met and responsibilities are balanced. Personal challenges and occasional reliance on others' self-management led to delays, emphasizing the importance of regular check-ins and mutual support.

Looking ahead, the team plans to prioritize clearer communication, more structured planning, and regular alignment checks. By fostering a proactive approach to deadlines and task distribution, future projects can build on the lessons learned and achieve even greater success.

### Reflection on Communication:
During this project, communication within the group has not always been the best, both within the team and with the client. Throughout the project, I learned how to handle communication more effectively and how to give the client a clearer understanding of the project's progress. In the future, I now understand how important communication can be during a project and how problematic miscommunication can become.

### Reflection on Learned Skills:
During this project, I expected to learn something new, such as working with vision systems or improving my skills in PLC programming and different communication protocols like IO-Link or Profibus. Unfortunately, this was not the case. However, I did learn a little about the Raspberry Pi, as I had not used it for programming before. I learned how to code on the Pi and how to control servos and stepper motors.

### Reflection on Delivered Work:
Regarding the work we delivered, I believe we did a good job as a group, considering the situation with the client. Despite the low budget we were given and the late delivery of components, we managed to complete our tasks effectively.

## Daan Scholten**
During this project, I noticed that communication within the group and with the client could have been better. It was sometimes unclear what still needed to be done. Better task division and earlier deadlines would have helped prevent delays and made our work more efficient.

Despite these challenges, I learned valuable lessons. I improved my collaboration skills and realized the importance of clear communication to align expectations. I also gained technical knowledge, learning how to use GitHub, Visual Studio, and PlantUML to keep our work organized.

In future projects, I want to focus on clearer communication and regularly checking that everyone is aligned. Additionally, I plan to take a more proactive role in setting priorities and deadlines to keep the project on track.

**Milan Oude Nijeweme**
During this project, I improved my skills in CNC mill coding and basic engineering. I designed the gripper and programmed it using SolidCAM for manufacturing.

I was also assigned the role of project leader, which was a new experience for me. Leading group members was initially quite challenging, but I feel I have significantly improved my leadership skills over the course of the project.

One important insight I gained was the necessity of clear communication with the client for an efficient workflow. Due to a lack of communication, partly caused by a language barrier, we encountered issues regarding the placement of the order list. 

In future projects, I aim to improve client communication and become a more assertive leader. I will strive to ensure tasks are completed within deadlines and distribute the workload more evenly among team members.

For the project , I effectively identified key risks and mitigation strategies, ensuring a proactive approach to potential challenges. My ability to assess and visualize risks through PlantUML diagrams allowed for clear communication of project vulnerabilities. 

I encountered some difficulties in quantifying certain risks, which I plan to address with more data-driven analysis in future assessments.

## Lars Schumacher

Over the past period, I’ve encountered some personal challenges that affected my time management. These issues caused occasional delays in meeting deadlines and balancing priorities effectively. I acknowledge that I could have handled my schedule better. These issues are now resolved and should be less present in the future.

Additionally, I realize I should have been more proactive in reminding and encouraging others to complete their tasks on time. There were moments when I relied too much on others to manage their responsibilities without providing adequate follow-up or reminders. Moving forward, I will make more effort to check in with teammates and offer support where necessary to ensure that deadlines are met collectively.
