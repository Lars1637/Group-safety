During this project, I noticed that communication within the group and with the client could have been better. It was sometimes unclear what still needed to be done. Better task division and earlier deadlines would have helped prevent delays and made our work more efficient.

Despite these challenges, I learned valuable lessons. I improved my collaboration skills and realized the importance of clear communication to align expectations. I also gained technical knowledge, learning how to use GitHub, Visual Studio, and PlantUML to keep our work organized.

In future projects, I want to focus on clearer communication and regularly checking that everyone is aligned. Additionally, I plan to take a more proactive role in setting priorities and deadlines to keep the project on track.

For the project , I effectively identified key risks and mitigation strategies, ensuring a proactive approach to potential challenges. My ability to assess and visualize risks through PlantUML diagrams allowed for clear communication of project vulnerabilities. 

I encountered some difficulties in quantifying certain risks, which I plan to address with more data-driven analysis in future assessments.

Over the past period, Iâ€™ve encountered some personal challenges that affected my time management. These issues caused occasional delays in meeting deadlines and balancing priorities effectively. I acknowledge that I could have handled my schedule better. These issues are now resolved and should be less present in the future.

Additionally, I realize I should have been more proactive in reminding and encouraging others to complete their tasks on time. There were moments when I relied too much on others to manage their responsibilities without providing adequate follow-up or reminders. Moving forward, I will make more effort to check in with teammates and offer support where necessary to ensure that deadlines are met collectively.
