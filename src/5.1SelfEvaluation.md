For the project , I effectively identified key risks and mitigation strategies, ensuring a proactive approach to potential challenges. My ability to assess and visualize risks through PlantUML diagrams allowed for clear communication of project vulnerabilities. 
I encountered some difficulties in quantifying certain risks, which I plan to address with more data-driven analysis in future assessments.

Over the past period, Iâ€™ve encountered some personal challenges that affected my time management. These issues caused occasional delays in meeting deadlines and balancing priorities effectively. I acknowledge that I could have handled my schedule better. These issues are now resolved and should be less present in the future.

Additionally, I realize I should have been more proactive in reminding and encouraging others to complete their tasks on time. There were moments when I relied too much on others to manage their responsibilities without providing adequate follow-up or reminders. Moving forward, I will make more effort to check in with teammates and offer support where necessary to ensure that deadlines are met collectively.
