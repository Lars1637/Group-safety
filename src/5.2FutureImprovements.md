**Improvement plan**

Communication with client:

One of the main challenges we've encountered is clearly understanding the client's needs, partly due to a language barrier. This has led to misunderstandings and inefficiencies. To improve communication, we plan to send documentation ahead of meetings, allowing the client to review and clarify any points before the discussion. This proactive approach will help reduce confusion, ensure alignment, and make meetings more productive by addressing potential issues beforehand.


Project group management:

One of the challenges we faced was the lack of a clear leader to assign tasks and remind team members of their responsibilities. This led to confusion and inefficiency in managing workloads. To address this, we are now implementing WhatsApp polls to streamline task assignment and ensure clarity in what needs to be done. Additionally, we are being more assertive in assigning work to specific individuals, making it clear who is responsible for each task. These changes aim to improve accountability, communication, and the overall flow of the project.


General documentation:

Keeping documents such as requirement specifications and architectural decision records (ADRs) up to date has been a challenge, often leading to misalignment and delays. To address this, we plan to schedule regular reviews to ensure all documentation reflects the current state of the project. 


Software functionality:

The software is set to include advanced timing-based calculation functionalities in a future update. This feature will allow users to input specific time-related parameters, such as cycle durations or process intervals, to perform precise computations. Once implemented, these calculations can be utilized for scenarios like synchronization, scheduling, and throughput optimization. With this planned addition. operations.


Improvement of drive system:

Switching from an all-screw drive system to a belt drive is a strategic improvement that offers several key advantages. Belt drives are faster and more efficient, as they can achieve higher speeds with lower energy consumption due to reduced friction compared to screw mechanisms. Maintenance is simplified with belt drives, as they are less prone to wear and require fewer adjustments over time. The reduced weight and cost of a belt drive system further enhance its suitability for modern, lightweight, and cost-effective designs.
