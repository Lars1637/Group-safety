# System Diagrams
Blueprint, communication, and safety diagrams each play essential roles in visualizing and understanding complex automated systems. Below is an introduction to these types of diagrams, using a sample automation system for detecting, identifying, and sorting various types of metal on a conveyor belt.


Blueprint Diagrams:

Blueprint diagrams provide a structural and spatial overview of the system setup, including the arrangement of all key components, such as conveyors, cameras, and sorting robots. For this automation system, a blueprint diagram might show the camera’s position relative to the conveyor belt, the layout of bins for different types of metals, and the reach area of the Cartesian Robot. This view is crucial for understanding the physical setup and ensuring that components are effectively positioned to achieve seamless operation.


Communication Diagrams:

Communication diagrams focus on the information exchange between components, detailing how data flows through the system. In this setup, as metal objects travel along the conveyor belt, the camera identifies each item’s type and location, sending this data to the Cartesian Robot if an object is recognized. The robot then uses this information to position itself, pick up the identified object, and place it in the correct bin. If the metal type is not recognized, the communication system ensures the item continues along the conveyor to an "unknown" bin. Communication diagrams help clarify these interactions, ensuring that data moves smoothly between components to support efficient sorting.


Safety Diagrams:

Safety diagrams illustrate the safety measures and protocols within the system to prevent accidents and maintain a secure working environment. For this system, a safety diagram could highlight barriers around the conveyor, emergency stop buttons, or sensors to detect human presence near moving parts. It might also include interlocks that halt the conveyor if an object jams or if the robot encounters an unexpected obstacle. This ensures that both the equipment and any operators nearby remain safe throughout the continuous sorting process.

Each of these diagrams provides a different perspective, helping engineers and operators gain a well-rounded understanding of the system’s design, functionality, and safety protocols. Together, they support the implementation, troubleshooting, and optimization of complex automated processes.
