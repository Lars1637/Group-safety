# Use Of Safety Standarts
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Conveyor Belt Safety Barrier:

ISO 14120: This standard specifies requirements for physical guards, such as barriers, to prevent people from directly accessing dangerous machine parts. The barrier should be robust, durable, and not easily removable without tools. This setup protects both people and the equipment from potential damage.

Emergency Stop:
ISO 13850: This standard specifies requirements for emergency stop equipment for machines. An emergency stop must be easily accessible and intuitively recognizable (e.g., a red button with a yellow background). The emergency stop should immediately shut down the machine upon activation and must not automatically restart after the issue is resolved; a manual reset is required.

Proximity Sensor:
ISO 10218-1 and ISO 10218-2: These standards cover the safety requirements for industrial robots and robot cells. Proximity sensors can be used to activate a “safeguarded stop” when someone comes too close to the robot. These standards also specify that robots should remain within a designated workspace, and proximity sensors help achieve this by setting boundaries for the robot’s working area.

ISO/TS 15066: This technical specification focuses on collaboration between humans and robots. It establishes additional safety requirements for environments where humans and robots work side by side. Proximity sensors can help reduce the risk of injury by ensuring that the robot stops or slows down whenever someone enters the workspace.
