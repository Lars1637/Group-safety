# Potential Problems
To ensure smooth operation and minimize disruptions, it’s important to anticipate and address potential issues in each process. Below is an overview of possible problems and measures to mitigate them.

1. General Issues
   - Breakdowns or Malfunctions: Equipment failures due to wear and tear or technical faults.
   - Software Bugs: Errors in programming affecting performance.
   - Power Problems: Interruptions or insufficient power supply.
   - Lack of Precision: Inaccurate operations due to calibration or design flaws.
   - Challenging Work Environment: Poor lighting, extreme or contamination can hinder performance.
   - Communication Issues: Inefficient data exchange between different processes can lead to errors.
   - Misalignment: Improper positioning of components affecting workflow.
   - Synchronization Problems: Mismatched timing between interconnected processes.
2. Camera
   - Incorrect Material Detection: AI may misidentify the material type, leading to sorting errors.
   - Faulty Coordinates: The camera may provide incorrect positional data to the machine.
3. Flippers
   - Inadequate Motor Strength: Servo motors may struggle to handle heavier objects.
   - Close Proximity of Metals: Overlapping or tightly packed metals can hinder separation.
   - Metal Obstructions: Bits of metal can get stuck under the flippers, reducing effectiveness.
4. Robot
   - Connectivity Issues: Network or communication failures impacting robot control.
   - System Complexity: The robot’s design or interface may be difficult to operate or troubleshoot.
5. Gripper
   - Insufficient Strength: The solenoid may not generate enough force to pick up heavier parts.
   - Shape Challenges: Irregularly shaped metals may be difficult to grip securely.
   - Close Proximity of Metals: Metals positioned too closely can prevent effective picking.
   - Orientation Issues: Poor alignment of materials may make gripping inefficient.
  
**Preventative Measures**
To reduce the likelihood of these issues, the following steps can be implemented:

Regular Inspections: Conduct frequent checks to identify and address wear, tear, or misalignments early.
Material Selection: Use high-quality, durable materials tailored to the specific demands of each process to reduce the risk of failures.
Routine Calibration: Regularly calibrate equipment to improve accuracy and consistency in sorting and handling.
Environmental Optimization: Maintain a clean and suitable working environment to support optimal performance.
By taking these measures, the overall efficiency and reliability of the system can be significantly enhanced, reducing downtime and ensuring better results.
