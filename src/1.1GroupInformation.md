# Work Distribution
To ensure an equitable distribution of work, we have chosen to divide the chapters of the mdBook equally among all team members. This approach ensures that everyone has a meaningful contribution to the project and takes responsibility for a specific section. By sharing the workload in this way, we promote collaboration, fairness, and a balanced effort from the entire team, ultimately enhancing the quality of the final product.
