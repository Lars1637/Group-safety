# Error Handeling
1. Possible faults or errors:
   a. Power failure
   b. Failed to establish connection to camera system
   c. Failed to home robot
   d. Robot not or eratically moving
   e. Robot not in Expected position
   f. Flippers non functional

2. How to handle error:
   
   **a. Power failure**
   Fault Trigger:

    When the system experiences a sudden loss of power.
    Possible causes: Power supply failure, loose cables, or an external power outage.

    Recovery/Reset:

    Restore power to the system and verify stable voltage levels.
    Ensure all connections are secure.
    Restart the system, ensuring a controlled initialization process.
    Check for any data corruption or system errors caused by the abrupt shutdown.

    **b. Failed to establish connection to camera system**
    Fault Trigger:

    When the system cannot detect or connect to the camera during initialization or operation.
    Possible causes: Network issue, incorrect IP configuration, hardware failure.

    Recovery/Reset:

    Check camera power and physical connections.
    Ensure the IP configuration matches (e.g., static IP or DHCP setup).
    Restart the camera and the system.
    Verify the camera is accessible via diagnostics tools (e.g., vendor software for Allied Vision Manta).
    If persistent, reset to factory settings or reconfigure the camera

    **c. Failed to home robot**
    Fault Trigger:

    When the robot fails to reach the home position during a homing sequence.
    Possible causes: Obstructions, sensor misalignment, motor/encoder issues, or software configuration errors.

    Recovery/Reset:

    Inspect for physical obstructions or interference.
    Check sensor alignment and functionality.
    Reset the homing parameters and retry the homing process.
    Verify motor function and encoder feedback.
    If unresolved, restart the system and recalibrate.

    **d. Robot not or eratically moving**
    Fault Trigger:

    When the robot's movements are unresponsive, jerky, or inconsistent with commands.
    Possible causes: Motor issues, stepper driver problems, mechanical faults, or software glitches.

    Recovery/Reset:

    Inspect mechanical components for wear, obstructions, or misalignment.
    Verify motor wiring and driver settings.
    Check the belt drives
    Check software for proper command sequencing and ensure no conflicts.
    Restart the system and reinitialize the motion control system.

    **e. Robot not in Expected position**
    Fault Trigger:

    When the robot deviates from the expected position during operation.
    Possible causes: Missed steps or external interference.

    Recovery/Reset:

    Perform a homing sequence to reestablish the robot's reference position.
    Inspect for mechanical backlash or slippage.
    Analyze logs for command discrepancies.

    **f. Flippers non functional**
    Fault Trigger:

    When the flipper mechanism fails to respond or perform its intended action.
    Possible causes: Mechanical jam, motor/servo failure, or communication issue.

    Recovery/Reset:

    Inspect the flipper mechanism for jams or blockages.
    Test the motor/servo functionality and replace if defective.
    Check the communication link (e.g., wiring, protocols) to ensure proper control signals.
    Restart and test the flipper system in isolation.
