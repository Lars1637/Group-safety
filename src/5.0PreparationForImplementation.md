# Preparation for Implementation

As part of our preparation for the implementation phase of the Project Industrial Automation, our group has conducted a thorough self-evaluation of our teamwork. This evaluation provided insights into our strengths and areas that require improvement.

Additionally, we have engaged in discussions about future improvements to ensure the success of our 2nd quartile objectives. 

This analysis  will serve as the foundation for a more streamlined and successful implementation process in the upcoming phase.
